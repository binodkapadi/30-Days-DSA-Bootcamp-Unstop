-------------Clean the Record---------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
The employees of a warehouse maintain a record of items that were brought in and taken out of it each day. The items taken
out are represented as negative integers, and items brought in are represented as non-negative integers.The employees
noticed that some of the entries in today’s record had been repeated by mistake.The record has been given as a sorted
linked list, and the employees ask for your help to get a new sorted linked list containing only the unique entries in it.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the number of entries in the record.The second line of the 
input contains N space-separated integers a1, a2, …, aN denoting the entries in the record in sorted order.


OUTPUT FORMAT
The first line of the output should contain a single integer M denoting the number of elements in the resultant linked list.
If M > 0, the second line of the output should contain M unique integers representing the linked list representing the 
updated record.


CONSTRAINTS
0 <= N <= 10^6
-10^6 <= a1 <= a2 <= … <= aN <= 10^6


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
3
1 1 2
Testcase Output
2
1 2
Explanation
The given linked list is 1 -> 1 -> 2. We can observe that the elements at indices 1 and 2 are the same. After removing one
of the elements, the new linked list will be 1->2


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
5
1 1 2 3 3
Testcase Output
3
1 2 3
Explanation
The given linked list is 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3. We can observe that elements at indices 1, 2 and 4, 5 are the same. After
removing elements at indices 1 and 4, the new linked list will be 1 -> 2 -> 3.
