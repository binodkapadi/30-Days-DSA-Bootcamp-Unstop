PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given a singly linked list where each node contains a single-digit integer, your task is to process the linked list to
determine a specific property of the resulting number. First, concatenate the digits of the linked list sequentially to 
form a single number. Reverse this number, and calculate the sum of its digits. Subtract this sum from the reversed number,
and check whether the resulting value is an even or a odd.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line of input contains a single integer N, representing the size of linked list.The second line of input contains 
singly linked list represented by a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a single-digit integer (0-9) separated by
space.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Return even if the final number is an even number. Otherwise, return odd.


CONSTRAINTS
1 <= N <= 15
0 <= node <= 9


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
5
3 2 2 8 9
Testcase Output
odd
Explanation
We have: 3 -> 2 -> 2 -> 8 -> 9.
After concatenating, we get: 32289
Reverse: 98223.
Sum of digits: 9 + 8 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 24
Reverse - Sum = 98223 - 24 = 98199 (odd).


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
3
0 1 2
Testcase Output
even
Explanation
We have: 0 -> 1-> 2.
After concatenating: 012 , i.e. 12
Reverse: 21
Sum of digits: 1 + 2 = 3
Reverse - Sum : 21 - 3 = 18 (even)
