----------------Find a way-------------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Robert wants to organize a marathon across your city.The city has landmarks numbered from to that can act as starting or 
finishing points. The landmarks are connected by roads. Each road has a length of n. The city map resembles a binary tree
in which each landmark represents a vertex of the tree, and each road represents an edge. The tree is rooted at vertex 1.As 
the first step in planning, he wants to find the longest simple path between any two landmarks in the city.Help Robert to
find the maximum length of the marathon he can organize.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains an integer  - the number of landmarks in the city.The next n lines describe the binary tree 
structure of the city. The ith line contains two integers li and ri – the indices of the left and right children of the ith
vertex, respectively. If some child doesn't exist, then the number “-1” is set instead.It is guaranteed that the given
graph is a binary tree rooted at vertex 1.


OUTPUT FORMAT
The output should consist of a single integer in a new line, the maximum length of the marathon that Robert can organize.


CONSTRAINTS
 1 ≤ n ≤ 4*10^4

Testcase Output
3
Explanation
From the given tree, we can observe that length of one of the longest paths highlighted in the figure is 4. One of the ways 
to organize the marathon is to start at landmark 2 and end at landmark 4.

Explanation
From the given tree, we can see that the highlighted path is the longest, and its length is 5. The marathon can be started 
at landmark 3 and ended at landmark 4.
