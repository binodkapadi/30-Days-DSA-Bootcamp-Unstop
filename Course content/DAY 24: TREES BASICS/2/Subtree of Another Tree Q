PROBLEM STATEMENT
Marco is fond of storybooks. He is currently reading a very interesting book where there is a concept of a parallel world.
Two worlds will be called parallel if one world is completely a subpart of the other one in terms of structure and value.
The world has countries that are connected with each other in the form of a tree.Marco is curious about whether World B is
a parallel world to World A or not.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains an integer N, the number of inputs representing the structure of countries in World A including
‘null’.The second line contains N strings which represent numbers countriesA[i] where 0 ≤ i < N .The third line contains
an integer M, the number of inputs representing the structure of countries in World B including ‘null’.The fourth line
contains M strings which represent numbers countriesB[i] where 0 ≤ i < M .


OUTPUT FORMAT
The first line contains ‘YES’ if World B is parallel world to World A , otherwise ‘NO’.


CONSTRAINTS
-10^5 <= N,M <= 10^5
-10^4 <= countriesA[i], countriesB[i] <= 10^4
‘null’  in countriesA[i] , countriesB[i] represents NULL value.

4 1 2
Testcase Output
NO
Explanation
Here , The world B is not parallel world to world A as there is a left node at right side which is not NULL.
