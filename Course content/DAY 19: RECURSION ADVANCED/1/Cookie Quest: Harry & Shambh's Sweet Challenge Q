--------------Cookie Quest: Harry & Shambh's Sweet Challenge----------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Harry and Shambh are employees at a chocolate factory who have grown tired of their daily routine. To break the monotony,
they decide to engage in a game over lunch. The game involves reaching exactly N cookies from an initial count of 0 cookies
within a maximum of K moves.
Game Rules:
Harry and Shambh take turns making moves.
Harry always moves first.
In each move:
Harry can add or subtract X cookies, where X is the count of even divisors of N.
Shambh can add or subtract Y cookies, where Y is the count of odd divisors of N.
Your task is to determine if they can reach exactly N cookies within K moves. If they can, output "YES" followed by the
minimum number of moves required. If they cannot, output "NO".


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains an integer 'N' representing the target number of cookies.The second line contains an integer 'K'
representing the maximum number of moves allowed.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print "YES" followed by the minimum number of moves required if it is possible to reach exactly N cookies within K moves.
Print "NO" if it is not possible.


CONSTRAINTS
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= K <= 10^5


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
15
2
Testcase Output
NO
Explanation
Harry starts, X (number of even divisors of 15) is 0.
Shambh follows, Y (number of odd divisors of 15) is 4 (1, 3, 5, 15).
They cannot reach 15 cookies in just 2 moves.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
10
5
Testcase Output
YES 5
Explanation
Harry starts, X (number of even divisors of 10) is 2 (12, 10). Shambh follows, Y (number of odd divisors of 10) is 2 (1, 5).
They can reach 10 cookies in 3 moves: Harry adds 2 cookies (0 + 2 = 2),
Shambh adds 2 cookie (2+ 2 = 4),
Harry adds 2 cookies (4 + 2 = 6).
Shambh adds 2 cookie (6+ 2 = 8),
Harry adds 2 cookies (8 + 2 = 10).
Thus, they reach 10 cookies in 5 moves.
