------------Maximizing Nutritional Value--------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Alice goes to a grocery store to buy fruits for her smoothie shop. There are n varieties of fruits numbered from 1 to n.
The price of the ith fruit is the price[i], and the nutritional value of it is a nutrition[i]. Alice also has k discount
coupons, and each coupon can only be used on one item. By using a discount coupon, the price of any variety of fruit can 
be reduced to half of its original value (floor value). Alice only has m amount of money, and she wants to buy fruits to
maximize their total nutritional value.Find the maximum nutritional value Alice can get. Note: Alice can only buy at most 
one unit of each fruit.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains three space-separated integers, n, m, and k. The next line contains n space-separated integers 
denoting the array price[i]. The next line contains n space-separated integers denoting the array nutrition[i].


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print a single integer denoting the maximum nutritional value Alice can get, as described in the problem statement.


CONSTRAINTS
1 ≤  n, m ≤  10^3
1 ≤  k ≤  10
1 ≤  price[i] ≤ 10^3
1 ≤  nutrition[i] ≤ 10^3

9 7 6 100
Testcase Output
9
Explanation
Alice has 4 varieties of fruits and 4 units of money. She also has 1 discount coupon. Alice can apply a discount on the 
first fruit, which she can get at (8/2) = 4 dollars. The nutritional value that she will get will be 9. This is the maximum
nutritional value she can get by using 4 dollars using a discount coupon.

20 17 15 10
Testcase Output
37
Explanation
Alice has 4 varieties of fruits and 4 units of money. She also has 1 discount coupon.She could select fruit numbers 1 and 2 
and apply a discount on the second fruit. This way, the total cost incurred would be 2 + (4/2): 4, and the nutritional
value would be 20 + 17 = 37. This is the maximum possible nutritional value that Alice can get after using 4 dollars and
using 1 discount coupon.
