-------------Line Formation----------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
On the occasion of Independence Day, students lined up in the form of a linked list for a prayer at school. However, 
the teacher wants them to rearrange themselves in non-decreasing order of their heights to present a better appearance.
Determine the number of students who need to change their positions to achieve the teacher's desired arrangement.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line of input contains an integer N, representing the size of the LinkedList.The second line of input contains N 
space-separated integers,representing the heights of the students in the LinkedList.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Display the minimum number of changes they must make to make the LinkedList in non-decreasing order.


CONSTRAINTS
1 ≤  N ≤10^6
1 ≤  Node.val ≤10^6


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
5
2 3 4 5 6
Testcase Output
0
Explanation
The values are already in the correct position, so the count is 0.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
5
1 8 27 2 3
Testcase Output
4
Explanation
The correct formation should be 
1 2 3 8 27
So, in 4 positions, the values are different.
