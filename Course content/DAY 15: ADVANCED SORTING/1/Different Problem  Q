---------------Different Problem--------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Lexi and her friend created a game where her friend selects a random number. Lexi's task is to determine the difference
between the maximum and minimum values that can be formed by rearranging the digits of that number.For example, if the 
chosen number is 231, Lexi can rearrange the digits to create the minimum value of 123 and the maximum value of 321.
The difference between these two values is 198.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains a single integer T, which indicates the number of test cases.The next T lines each contain a 
single integer, representing the number chosen by Lexi's friend.


OUTPUT FORMAT
For each test case, print a single integer representing the difference between the maximum and minimum possible values.


CONSTRAINTS
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^2
-10^5 ≤ num ≤ 10^5

Explanation
In the first test case, 
The minimum possible value is 123 and the maximum possible value is 321. The difference between the maximum and minimum 
values is 198. 
In the second test case, 
The minimum possible value is -7650 and the maximum possible value is -567. The difference between the maximum and
minimum values is 7083.

Explanation
1st testcase: -123
Minimum possible value: -321
Maximum Possible value: -123
Difference(max - min): -123 - (-321) = -123 + 321 = 198

2nd testcase: 456
Minimum possible value: 456
Maximum Possible value: 654
Difference(max - min): 654 - 456 = 198

3rd testcase: -789
Minimum possible value: -987
Maximum Possible value: -789
Difference(max - min): -789 - (-987) = -789 + 987 = 198

4th testcase: 789
Minimum possible value: 789
Maximum Possible value: 987
Difference(max - min): 987 - 789 = 198
