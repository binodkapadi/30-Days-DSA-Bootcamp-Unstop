--------------Maximizing Signal Strength: Help Me!!-------------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
An explorer is lost on a remote island in the middle of a vast sea. They find a small device that can send a distress
signal to call for help. However, the device is low on power and can’t run all its parts at once.The device has N 
components, each with an energy efficiency value. To make the signal as strong as possible, the explorer decides to turn 
off one out of every five components. The strength of the signal depends on the average efficiency of the components still
running.The explorer must carefully choose which components to turn off so the average efficiency of the remaining ones is 
as high as possible.Can you figure out which components the explorer should turn off to maximize the signal’s average 
strength?
Note:
Each component’s efficiency value is an integer.
The number of components is always a multiple of five.
The answer should show the highest possible average efficiency, rounded to five decimal places.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains an integer N, the number of components.The second line contains N space-separated integers, 
representing the efficiency values of the components.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print the highest possible average efficiency of the remaining components, rounded to five decimal places. If the number
of components are less than 5 then print 0.


CONSTRAINTS
5 <= N <= 10^2
1 <= efficiency of each comoponent <= 10^5


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
Testcase Output
3.50000
Explanation
Removing the component with efficiency 1 will result in the highest average of the remaining components. 
Removing the component with efficiency 1 leaves the components 2, 3, 4, and 5, resulting in an average efficiency of (2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 3.50000.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
10
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
Testcase Output
65.00000
Explanation
We need to remove 1 component  for every 5 components. With 10 components, we need to remove 2 components. Removing 2 components optimally gives the maximum efficiency of 65.00000.
