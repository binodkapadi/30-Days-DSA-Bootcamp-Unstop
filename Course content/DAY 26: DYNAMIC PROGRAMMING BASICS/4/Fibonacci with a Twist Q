------------Fibonacci with a Twist-------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a number N and asked to calculate X based on the following recurrence rules:
Base cases:
If N = 0, then X = 5.
If N = 1, then X = 3.
For N > 1, the recurrence is as follows:
If N is odd, then X = (F(N-1) + F(N-2)) mod 998.
If N is even, then X = (F(N-1) * F(N-2)) mod 999.
Where F(N) represents the value of X for N calculated according to the above rules.
Task: Given a number N, help calculate X efficiently.


INPUT FORMAT
The first and only line of input contain a single integer N.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print the value of X.


CONSTRAINTS
0 <= N <= 10^5


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
10
Testcase Output
675
Explanation
Given N = 10,
We need to calculate F[2], F[3], F[4], ... , F[9], such that
F[10] = (F[9] + F[8]) mod 999, which will give answer = 675.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
5
Testcase Output
288
Explanation
Given N = 5,
We need to calculate F[2], F[3] and F[4], such that
F[5] = (F[4] + F[3]) mod 998, which will give answer = 288.
