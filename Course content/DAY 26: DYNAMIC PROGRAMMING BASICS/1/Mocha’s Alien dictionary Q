can be segmented into a sequence of one or more words from Mocha's Alien dictionary. Note: The words in the dictionary 
contain unique words of lowercase English letters and can be found multiple times in the segmentation.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains a string S given by John.The second line contains N, which is the length of the dictionary of 
strings of Mocha. The following N lines are different strings that are present in the Mocha's Alien dictionary.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print "true" if the string given by John can be segmented into a sequence of one or more words of Mocha's Alien dictionary.
Else, print "false".


CONSTRAINTS
1 <= S.length() <= 3*10^2
1<= N <= 10^3
1 <= Ki.length() <= 20


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
applepenapple
2
apple
pen
Testcase Output
true
Explanation
In the first sample test case, we can make “applepenapple” using the string “apple” and “pen” by concatenation of the
strings “apple”+”pen”+”apple”. So print true for this test case.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
catsandog
5
cats
dog
sand
and
cat
Testcase Output
false
Explanation
Although we can form the prefix "cats" + "and", the remaining "og" cannot be formed using the dictionary words. Hence, 
segmentation is not possible.so false
