-------------------The Quest for the Secure Vault------------------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
In the city of Numerica, renowned for its technological advancements, a high-security facility named Vault-Prime safeguards 
the city's most precious artifacts and treasures. This vault is said to be unbreakable, protected by a cutting-edge PIN 
code system designed by the genius mathematician and inventor, Dr. Meta. Dr. Meta's secure locker system is unlike any
other. The PIN codes used for accessing Vault-Prime must follow specific mathematical rules to ensure their uniqueness and
uncrackable nature:
The PIN is a string of digits, with a length determined by the level of access required.
Positions within the PIN follow a prime-numbered indexing system (1-based):
Prime indices are only allowed to hold prime digits.
Non-prime indices must contain even digits.
The Chief of Security, Clara Cipher, now faces a daunting task. She must calculate the total number of valid PINs that can 
be generated for any given PIN length N to ensure that every access code remains unique and mathematically secure. However,
Vault-Prime is equipped with an advanced computational system that can only handle numbers modulo 10^9 + 7, as the results
can grow astronomically large. Clara knows the city’s security depends on this calculation. Can she figure out the total
number of valid PINs for a given length N? Will the Vault-Prime remain secure?


INPUT FORMAT
The first line of input contains a single integer N, representing the length of the PIN.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print a single integer representing the count of the valid PIN.


CONSTRAINTS
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
2
Testcase Output
20
Explanation
There will be 20 possible PIN with length 2 while adhering to the constraints.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
1
Testcase Output
5
Explanation
The PIN will be of length 1.
Since it is 1 based indexing, the only index is 1 (non-prime number)
So only even digit wil be assigned in non-prime index which is 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
