---------------------Palindrome Maker: Insert or Delete---------------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Alice loves palindromes. She has been given a string S of length N, and she can perform up to K operations on the string.
Each operation can either be an insertion or a deletion of a character at any position in the string. The goal is to 
determine how many distinct palindromic strings can be formed after exactly K operations and also return the 
lexicographically smallest palindrome that can be created. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and 
backwards.
Operations:
Insertion: You can insert any character at any position in the string.
Deletion: You can delete any character from the string.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line of input contains N and K.
The Second line of input contains the string S.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Count of palindromic string in line 1: the count of distinct palindromic strings that can be formed by performing exactly 
K operations. Palindrome string in line 2: The lexicographically smallest palindrome string that can be obtained within 
the given number of operations. If it is impossible to create a palindrome within at most K operations, output -1.


CONSTRAINTS
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= k < N


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
5 2
hello
Testcase Output
-1
Explanation
The output -1 indicates that it is not possible to generate a palindrome by inserting or deleting characters from
"hello" up to 2 times


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
4 3
race
Testcase Output
40
a
Explanation
After all operations, the set will have 40 distinct palindromic strings, including:
Single-character palindromes like "a".
Multi-character palindromes like "racecar".
The smallest lexicographically palindrome will be "a".
