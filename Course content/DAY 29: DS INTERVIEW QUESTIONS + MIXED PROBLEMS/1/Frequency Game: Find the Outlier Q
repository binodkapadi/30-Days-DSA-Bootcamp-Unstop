QUESTION ==>>

PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given an array nums of size N. A minority element is defined as the element that has a frequency closest to the
median frequency of all elements in the array. If there are multiple elements that satisfy this condition, follow these 
rules: Return the index the element with the smallest value among them. If there is a tie, return the index of the first
occurrence of the chosen minority element. The array may contain negative numbers, and the size of the array N is always at 
least 3.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains a single integer, N, representing the size of the array nums. The second line contains N space
separated integers, representing the elements of the array nums.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print a single integer, representing the 1-based index of the first occurrence of the chosen minority element.


CONSTRAINTS
3 <= N <= 10^5
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4.
The array contains at least 3 unique elements.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
5
10 20 30 40 50
Testcase Output
1
Explanation
Frequency Calculation:
All elements (10, 20, 30, 40, 50) appear once, so their frequencies are 1.

Median Frequency:
The list of frequencies is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The median frequency is 1.
Choosing the Minority Element:
All elements have the same frequency. The smallest element is 10 and is at index 1 (1 based indexing).


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
8
32 9 58 99 9 32 99 58
Testcase Output
2
Explanation
Frequency Calculation: 32:2, 9:2, 58:2, 99:2.
Median Frequency:
The list of frequencies is [2, 2, 2, 2]. The median frequency is 2.
Choosing the Minority Element:
All elements have the same frequency of 2. The smallest element is 9.
First Occurrence:
The first occurrence of 9 is at index 2 (1-based indexing).
