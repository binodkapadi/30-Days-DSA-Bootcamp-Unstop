--------------Optimal Instructions--------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
In a remote control car game, a player can use 4 buttons on a control device to move the car in 4 directions: Forward (F), 
Backward (B), Left (L), and Right (R). The car's movement needs to be optimized by deleting unnecessary instructions while
maintaining the same final destination. This is important because each instruction takes time to execute, and reducing the
number of instructions can make the gameplay smoother and faster. Initially, the car is at position (0, 0) in an infinitely
large grid. Given the original set of instructions for the car in the form of a string, STR, consisting of only four 
characters: ‘F’, ‘B’, ‘L’, and ‘R’, what is the maximum number of instructions that can be deleted and still have the car
reach the destination?


INPUT FORMAT
A single line containing a string, STR, consisting of only four characters:  ‘F’, ‘B’, ‘L’ and ‘R’, representing the
directions in which the car can move.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print a single integer, the maximum number of instructions that can be deleted, and still have the car reach the destination.


CONSTRAINTS
1 <= |STR| <= 10^5


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
RFBL
Testcase Output
4
Explanation
We can delete all the characters in the instruction string since after deleting them, the car will still be at its initial
position, i.e. (0, 0). Hence the answer is 4.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
BBB
Testcase Output
0
Explanation
Here it is impossible to delete any character from the instruction string since we cannot reach the final destination after 
deleting any characters from the string. Hence the answer is 0.
