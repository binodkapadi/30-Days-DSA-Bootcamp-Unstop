--------------Math Competition-------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Three participants attended a math competition. In each round, two participants solved a problem:The correct solver gets 2 
points.If both solve it correctly, each gets 1 point.If neither solves it, each gets 0 points.Given final scores s1, s2,
and s3, determine the maximum number of problems where both participants solved it correctly. If it's impossible to achieve
these scores, output -1.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line of input contains 3 space separated integers s1,s2 and s3 representing final scores of all the three
participants.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print the maximum number of problems where two participants solved the question correctly. If it's impossible to achieve 
the given scores, output -1.


CONSTRAINTS
0<=s1<=s2<=s3<=5*10^2


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
0 2 2
Testcase Output
2
Explanation
Participant 1 has 0 points, so they did not win any games. Participants 2 and 3 each have 2 points, which can be achieved 
if they played two games against each other and both solved the problem correctly in each game, earning 1 point each per 
game.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
1 1 1
Testcase Output
-1
Explanation
It's impossible to achieve scores of 1, 1, and 1 for all three participants. Given the scoring rules, no valid sequence of 
games can result in all participants having exactly 1 point.
