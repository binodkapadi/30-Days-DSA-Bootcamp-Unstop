------------Test Scores------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
The exam scores for a class of N students have been released. The marks obtained by each student are stored in an array of 
scores[], where scores[i] represent the marks of the ith student.As the class monitor, Ram is tasked with answering queries
from the teacher. The teacher will ask Q queries, and for each query, Ram needs to determine how many students have scored 
at least X marks.Your objective is to help Ram by finding the number of students who have scored at least X marks for each 
query.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains two positive integers N, and Q, denoting the number of students and the number of queries,
respectively.This is followed by a line containing N integers, separated by space giving the scores of each student.Then,
Q lines follow where the ith line contains a single integer X.


OUTPUT FORMAT
For each query, print a single integer representing the number of students who scored at least X marks.


CONSTRAINTS
1 <= N, Q <= 2 * 10^5
1 <= X <= 10^9
1 <= scores[i] <= 10^9

0
Explanation
There are 5 students with scores [1, 4, 12, 3, 9].

The first query asks for the number of students who scored at least 2 marks. The students with scores [4, 12, 3, 9] meet
this criterion, resulting in 4 students.
The second query asks for the number of students who scored at least 15 marks. No student meets this criterion, resulting 
in 0 students.
Therefore, the outputs are 4 and 0 respectively.
