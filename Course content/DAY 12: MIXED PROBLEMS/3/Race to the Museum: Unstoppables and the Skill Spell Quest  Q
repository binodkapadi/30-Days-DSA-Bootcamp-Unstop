------Race to the Museum: Unstoppables and the Skill Spell Quest------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
In the city of Unstop, there are ( n ) citizens known as Unstoppables located at positions ( A[i] ) along a straight avenue.
Additionally, there are ( m ) precious skill spells located at positions ( B[i] ) scattered along the same avenue.Each
Unstoppable must collect one skill spell and deliver it to the central museum located at position ( p ) on the avenue.Each 
Unstoppable moves at a speed of one unit distance per second. If multiple Unstoppables reach a skill spell simultaneously,
only one can claim it, and the others must find another skill spell.Once a skill spell is taken, it cannot be claimed by
another Unstoppable.The goal is to determine the minimum time required for all ( n ) Unstoppables to deliver their collected
skill spells to the museum.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains three integers ( n ), ( m ), and ( p ), the number of Unstoppables, the number of skill spells, and
the position of the museum, respectively.The second line contains ( n ) space-separated integers ( A[i] ) the positions of
the Unstoppables.The third line contains ( m ) space-separated  integers ( B[i] ) the positions of the skill spells.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print a single integer the minimum time required for all ( n ) Unstoppables to deliver their skill spells to the museum.


CONSTRAINTS
1 <= n, m <= 10^5
1 <= A[i], B[i], p <= 10^9


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
2 3 5
1 4
3 6 8
Testcase Output
4
Explanation
Unstoppable at position 1 goes to skill spell at position 3 and then to the museum at position 5: Time = ( |1 - 3| + |3 - 5|
= 2 + 2 = 4 )
Unstoppable at position 4 goes to skill spell at position 6 and then to the museum at position 5: Time = ( |4 - 6| + |6 - 5|
= 2 + 1 = 3 )
Minimum time is the maximum of these times: ( max(4, 3) = 4 )

3 6 8
Testcase Output
9
Explanation
Unstoppable at position 1 goes to skill spell at position 3 and then to the museum at position 10: Time = ( |1 - 3| +
|3 - 10| = 2 + 7 = 9 )
Unstoppable at position 5 goes to skill spell at position 6 and then to the museum at position 10: Time = ( |5 - 6| +
|6 - 10| = 1 + 4 = 5 )
Unstoppable at position 7 goes to skill spell at position 8 and then to the museum at position 10: Time = ( |7 - 8| +
|8 - 10| = 1 + 2 = 3 )
Minimum time is the maximum of these times: ( max(9, 5, 3) = 9 )
