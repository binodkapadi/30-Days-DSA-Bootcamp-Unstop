------------Prime-Cursed Path in the Fruitful Forest------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT:

In the Fruitful Forest, there is a grid of trees bearing the most delicious sweet fruits. These trees are arranged neatly
in rows, and each row is carefully enclosed by a wire fence. The entrance to the forest is located at the top-left corner,
and it's the only way to enter. To move deeper into the forest, one must follow a strict path:From the entrance, you must 
begin at the first tree in the top-left corner and travel to the end of the first row in right direction.Once you reach the
end of the row, you must move down to the second row and continue your journey in left direction.This process repeats for 
every row in the forest, following a zig-zag pattern: top-left -> right-end -> down to second row -> left-end -> down to 
3rd row and so on...As you move through the grid, you need to check the number of fruits on each tree. If the number of
fruits on a tree is a prime number, you must skip that tree and continue your journey, as those fruits are cursed. Only the
trees with non-prime numbers of fruits are worth stopping for and collecting.After completing the collection, print the
list of non-prime numbers of fruits you encounter. If all numbers encountered are prime, print -1 to indicate that no 
non-prime fruits were found.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains two space separated integers M and N representing the number of rows and columns of the forest
grid, repectively.The next M lines contain N space separated integers each, representing the number of fruits on each tree
in the forest grid.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print the non-prime numbers of fruits encountered during the zigzag traversal, separated by spaces. If no non-prime numbers
are found, output -1.


CONSTRAINTS
1 ≤ M, N ≤ 50
1 ≤ matrix[i][j] ≤ 10^4


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
2 2
2 3
5 7
Testcase Output
-1
Explanation
2* -> 3* -> 7* -> 5* ('*' means discard)
All numbers are prime, so the output is -1.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
3 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
10 11 12
Testcase Output
4 6 9 8 10 12
Explanation
Traverse the forest in a zigzag pattern as specified, excluding prime numbers: 5, 7, 11
4 -> 5* -> 6 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7* -> 10 -> 11* -> 12 ('*' means discard)
The tree with non-prime numbers of fruits are: 4, 6, 9, 8, 10, 12.
