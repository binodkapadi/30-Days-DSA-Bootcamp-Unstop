----------------Diagonal Sum-----------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Chris is at the entrance of Adventureland, where there is a magic grid of size N×N, filled entirely with the number 1.
To gain entry, he must quickly calculate the sum of the integers on both the main and secondary diagonals of the grid.
The main diagonal consists of elements where the row and column indices are the same, 
i.e., (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), ..., (N-1,N-1).The secondary diagonal consists of elements where the row index and column index
sum to N−1, i.e., (0,N-1), (1,N-2), (2,N-3), ..., (N-1,0).
Note: If N is odd, the center element (at index (N//2,N//2)) is counted twice, but it should only be considered 
once for the final sum.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line of input consists of integer N representing the number of rows and columns of the matrix.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print a single line of output consisting of the sum of the diagonal integers


CONSTRAINTS
1<= N <= 105


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
3
Testcase Output
5
Explanation
The matrix is:
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1

Main diagonal sum: 1+1+1=3
Secondary diagonal sum: 1+1+1=3
But the center element (1) is counted twice, so we subtract 1.
The total sum is 3+3−1=5.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
2
Testcase Output
4
Explanation
The matrix is:
1 1
1 1

Main diagonal sum: 1+1=2
Secondary diagonal sum: 1+1=2?
The total sum is 2+2=4.
