PROBLEM STATEMENT:

There are N suns in a galaxy, each sun has M planets, each of the M planets have some number of moons, denoted by 
galaxy(i)(j), where galaxy(i)(j) denotes the number of moons of the jth planet having the ith sun.Your task is to determine
the maximum number of moons in any solar system. For each sun, calculate the total number of moons across all its planets, 
and output the highest total number of moons found in a single solar system.
