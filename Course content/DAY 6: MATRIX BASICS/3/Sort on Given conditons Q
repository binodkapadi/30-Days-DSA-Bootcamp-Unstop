QUESTION  ===>

------------Sort on Given conditons------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT:

A matrix diagonal is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in either the topmost row or leftmost column and 
going in the bottom-right direction until reaching the matrix's end.For example, the matrix diagonal starting from 
mat[2][0], where mat is a 6 x 3 matrix, includes cells mat[2][0], mat[3][1], and mat[4][2].Given an m x n matrix mat of 
integers, sort each matrix diagonal in ascending order and return the resulting matrix.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains two space-seperated integers, M and N, representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
The next M lines each contain N space-seperated  integers, representing the elements of the matrix mat.Each line 
corresponds to a row in the matrix.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print the Diagonally sorted matrix. Each row of the matrix should be printed on a new line, as space-seperated integers.


CONSTRAINTS
1 <= M, N <= 10^2
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^2

Explanation

Step-by-Step Sorting:
Diagonal starting at mat[0][0]: [3, 2, 2] → Sorted: [2, 2, 3]
Diagonal starting at mat[0][1]: [3, 1] → Sorted: [1, 3]
Diagonal starting at mat[0][2]: [1] → Sorted: [1]
Diagonal starting at mat[1][0]: [2, 1] → Sorted: [1, 2]
Diagonal starting at mat[2][0]: [1] → Sorted: [1]
