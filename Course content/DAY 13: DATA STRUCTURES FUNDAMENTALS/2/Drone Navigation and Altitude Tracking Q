-------------------Drone Navigation and Altitude Tracking---------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
In a bustling city, a delivery drone was assigned a special task to navigate through a sequence of n+1 points on its route.
The drone's journey began at point 0, where its altitude was precisely 0 meters above sea level.As the drone traveled, 
it experienced changes in altitude due to urban landscapes, weather conditions, and delivery tasks. For every segment
between points i and i+1, where 0 ≤ i < n, the change in altitude was represented by an integer array called change, 
of length n. The value change[i] denoted the net change in altitude between points i and i+1. A positive value represented 
an ascent, while a negative value indicated a descent.However, the drone's battery and design imposed a unique constraint:
if the altitude at any point along the journey became negative, the drone would activate its emergency hover mode,
resetting the altitude to 0 meters at that point before continuing its journey.The drone's mission is to determine the
maximum altitude it reached during its journey, considering this unique altitude-resetting mechanism.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains an integer N, representing the number of elements in the array change.The second line contains N 
space-separated integers, the elements of the array change, where change[i] denotes the net change in altitude between
points i and i+1.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print a single integer, the maximum altitude the drone reached during its journey.


CONSTRAINTS
1 <= N <= 10^7
-10^8 <= change[i] <= 10^8


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
5
-4 2 3 -5 6
Testcase Output
6
Explanation
The journey begins at altitude 0.
After the first segment: Altitude = 0 + (-4) = -4 → resets to 0 due to hover mode.
After the second segment: Altitude = 0 + 2 = 2.
After the third segment: Altitude = 2 + 3 = 5.
After the fourth segment: Altitude = 5 + (-5) = 0 (no reset needed, already 0).
After the fifth segment: Altitude = 0 + 6 = 6.
The maximum altitude reached is 6.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
6
3 -2 4 -8 5 2
Testcase Output
7
Explanation
The journey begins at altitude 0.
After the first segment: Altitude = 0 + 3 = 3.
After the second segment: Altitude = 3 + (−2) = 1.
After the third segment: Altitude = 1 + 4 = 5.
After the fourth segment: Altitude = 5 + (−8) = −3→resets to 0 due to hover mode.
After the fifth segment: Altitude = 0 + 5 = 5.
After the sixth segment: Altitude = 5 + 2 = 7.
The maximum altitude reached is 7.
