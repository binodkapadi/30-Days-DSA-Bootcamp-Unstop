PROBLEM STATEMENT
In a classroom with N students and N available seats, each student has a preferred seat number, given in an array A.
Students enter the classroom one by one in order from student 1 to N.Each student follows these rules when choosing a
seat:If their preferred seat is vacant, they sit there.If their preferred seat is occupied, they continue searching 
circularly (wrapping around if needed) until they find an empty seat.Your task is to determine the final seating
arrangement of all students.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains an integer N (the number of students and seats).The second line contains N space-separated
integers representing the seat preferences of the students. The seat numbers are typically between 1 and N.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print a list of space-seperated integers representing the final seating arrangement, with each student seated in the 
correct order.


CONSTRAINTS
1 <= N <= 10^5.
1 <= A[i] <= N.

3 3 3
Testcase Output
3 1 2
Explanation
Initially, all seats are empty: [_, _, _].
Student 1 prefers seat 3, which is available. They take it: [_, _, S1].
Student 2 also prefers seat 3, but it’s occupied. They move circularly and take the next available seat 1: [S2, _, S1].
Student 3 also prefers seat 3, but it’s occupied. They move circularly and take the last available seat 2: [S2, S3, S1].
Final seating arrangement:
S1 takes Seat 3.
S2 takes Seat 1.
S3 takes Seat 2.
