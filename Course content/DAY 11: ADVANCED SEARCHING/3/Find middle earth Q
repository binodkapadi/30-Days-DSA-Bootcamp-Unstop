-------------Find middle earth----------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given two sorted arrays a1 and a2 of size m and n respectively. Now we combine the values of these two arrays
to make a mega array. The resulting mega array is also sorted in nature.You are helping a data analytics team that collects
numerical readings from two different sensors.Each sensor records values independently, and the readings may arrive in any
order.To perform meaningful analysis, the team must merge all readings into one unified dataset and determine a key 
statistic: the median.Given two arrays a1 and a2, containing m and n readings respectively, your task is to:Combine the 
readings from both sensors.Organize the combined data in non-decreasing order.Compute and return the median of the final
dataset.The median gives the central tendency of the combined sensor readings and helps the team judge the stability of 
the system.Your task is to find the median of this mega array.


INPUT FORMAT
Each Input has three lines, containing space-separated integers.The first line contains 2 values m and n respectively.
The second line contains m numbers that signify nums1.The third line contains n numbers that signify nums2.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print the median of the combined array as a floating-point number rounded to exactly one decimal place.


CONSTRAINTS
nums1.length == m
nums2.length == n
0 <= m <= 10^6
0 <= n <= 10^6
1 <= m + n <= 2*10^6
-10^4 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^6


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
2 2
1 3
2 4
Testcase Output
2.5
Explanation
Resulting array:- [1,2,3,4] 
Median of this array is ((2+3)/2) = 2.5
