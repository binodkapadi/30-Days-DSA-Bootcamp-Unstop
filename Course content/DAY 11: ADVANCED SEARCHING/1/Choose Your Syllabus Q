------------------Choose Your Syllabus-------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
In a classroom debate, two syllabuses—Syllabus 1 and Syllabus 2—are being compared to determine which one is more engaging 
for students. Each syllabus contains an equal number of chapters. The syllabus with the higher interest value is selected 
for teaching.Interest Value CalculationThe interest value of a syllabus is defined as the sum of the intent values of all
its chapters.The intent value of a chapter is determined as follows:For a given chapter in one syllabus, count the number
of chapters in the other syllabus that have an intrinsic value less than or equal to its own intrinsic value.The sum of 
these counts across all chapters gives the total interest value of the syllabus.The syllabus with the higher interest value 
is chosen.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains n, the number of chapters in both syllabuses.The second line contains n numbers, ai, the intrinsic 
values for all the chapters in syllabus 1.The third line contains n numbers, bi, the intrinsic values for all the chapters 
in syllabus 2


OUTPUT FORMAT
Your task is to print the highest interest value among both available syllabuses.


CONSTRAINTS
1<=n<=105
1<=ai<=109
1<=bi<=109


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
1
2
4
Testcase Output
1
Explanation
Syllabus 1: [2]
Intent value for chapter 2: 0 (since no chapters in Syllabus 2 have intrinsic values ≤ 2).
Total interest value of Syllabus 1 = 0.

Syllabus 2: [4]
Intent value for chapter 4: 1 (since one chapter in Syllabus 1 has an intrinsic value ≤ 4).
Total interest value of Syllabus 2 = 1.

The highest interest value is 1.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
5
1 2 6 3 2 
2 4 1 12 2
Testcase Output
16
Explanation
Intrinsic values for each syllabus:
Syllabus 1: [1, 2, 6, 3, 2]
Syllabus 2: [2, 4, 1, 12, 2]

Calculating interest values:
Syllabus 1:
Chapter 1 (1): Count of values in Syllabus 2 ≤ 1 → 1
Chapter 2 (2): Count of values in Syllabus 2 ≤ 2 → 3
Chapter 3 (6): Count of values in Syllabus 2 ≤ 6 → 4
Chapter 4 (3): Count of values in Syllabus 2 ≤ 3 → 3
Chapter 5 (2): Count of values in Syllabus 2 ≤ 2 → 3
Total interest value of Syllabus 1 = 1 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 14

Syllabus 2:
Chapter 1 (2): Count of values in Syllabus 1 ≤ 2 → 3
Chapter 2 (4): Count of values in Syllabus 1 ≤ 4 → 4
Chapter 3 (1): Count of values in Syllabus 1 ≤ 1 → 1
Chapter 4 (12): Count of values in Syllabus 1 ≤ 12 → 5
Chapter 5 (2): Count of values in Syllabus 1 ≤ 2 → 4
Total interest value of Syllabus 2 = 3 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 4 = 16

The highest interest value is 16.
