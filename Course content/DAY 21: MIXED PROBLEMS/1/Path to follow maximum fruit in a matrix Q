with walls and paths, the task is to find the path that collects the maximum number of fruits. The fruits are represented
by their names in the matrix, walls are represented by the string "wall", and empty paths are represented by the string 
"path". If there is no fruit in the matrix, return null.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line of input contains an integer N, representing the number of rows in the matrix.The second line of input
contains an integer M, representing the number of columns in the matrix.The third line of input contains space-seperated a
list of strings representing the matrix.Note: The matrix is of size N x M.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Display a List of strings, where each fruit in the path is separated by '-->'. If no fruit is present in the matrix, return
