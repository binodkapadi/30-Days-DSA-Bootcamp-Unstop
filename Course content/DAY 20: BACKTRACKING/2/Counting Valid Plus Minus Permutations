---------------Counting Valid Plus Minus Permutations------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a string S of length N where S[i] is either:
'+' means Increasing, or
'-' means Decreasing.
A permutation perm of n + 1 integers of all the integers in the range [0, n] is called a Plus Minus Sequence if for all 
valid i:
If s[i] == '-', then perm[i] > perm[i + 1], and
If s[i] == '+', then perm[i] < perm[i + 1].
Return the number of valid Plus Minus Sequences perms. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.


INPUT FORMAT
The first and only line will contain a single string S of length N containing only ‘+’ and ‘-’ as characters.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print a single integer denoting the number of valid Plus Minus Sequences.


CONSTRAINTS
1 ≤ n ≤ 104

Explanation
The 5 valid permutations of (0, 1, 2, 3) which are Plus Minus Sequences are:
(1, 0, 3, 2)
(2, 0, 3, 1)
(2, 1, 3, 0)
(3, 0, 2, 1)
(3, 1, 2, 0)
