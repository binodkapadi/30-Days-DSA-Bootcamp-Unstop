-----------Height Comparison-----------
PROBLEM STATEMENT:

You are given a line of N people, each with a certain height, represented by the array height. You are also given a number K,
which indicates the number of people you can view at once as you move through the line from the front to the rear.Your task 
is to find the tallest person among every group of K consecutive people as you slide the viewing window from the start of
the line to the end. For each position of the viewing window, record the height of the tallest person visible.

INPUT FORMAT
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers N and K, where N is the total number of people in the line 
and K is the number of people visible at one time.The second line of input contains N space-separated integers representing 
the array height[], where height[i] denotes the height of the ith person.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Print a space-separated list of integers representing the tallest person in each group of K consecutive people as you move 
from the front to the rear of the line.

CONSTRAINTS
K <= N <= 10^5
1 <= K <= N
1 <= height[i] <= 10^8
