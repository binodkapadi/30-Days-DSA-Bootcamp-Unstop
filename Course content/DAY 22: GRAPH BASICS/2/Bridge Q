PROBLEM STATEMENT
A country has N cities. Initially, there were bidirectional roads connecting every pair of different cities. However, M of
these roads have become unusable. Each unusable road connects two cities U and V. A person wants to plan a K-day trip, 
starting and ending in the same city, specifically city 1. Your task is to calculate the number of different K-day trips
that start and end in city 1, with the result being given modulo 998244353.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains three integers N, M, and K representing the number of cities, the number of unusable roads, and the
number of days for the trip.The next M lines each contain two integers Ui and Vi, representing an unusable road between 
city U and city V.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print a single integer representing the number of different K-day trips starting and ending in city 1, modulo 998244353.


CONSTRAINTS
2<=N<=5*10^3
0<=m<=min(n*(n-1)/2,5*10^3)
2<=k<=5*10^3
1<=ui<=vi<=N


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
3 3 3
1 2
1 3
2 3
Testcase Output
0
Explanation
In this case, all the roads between the cities have become unusable, making it impossible to complete any K-day trip
that starts and ends in city 1.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
3 1 4
2 3
Testcase Output
4
Explanation
In this case four different trips are possible (1,2,1,2,1) (1,2,1,3,1) (1,3,1,2,1) (1,3,1,3,1) resulting in a 
total of 4 valid trips.
