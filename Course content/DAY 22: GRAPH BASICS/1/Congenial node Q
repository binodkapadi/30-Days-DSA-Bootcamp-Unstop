----------------Congenial node-----------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a tree with N nodes labeled from 1 to N. The tree consists of N-1 edges, where the i-th edge connects the
nodes ui and vi.A congenial node is a node that is directly connected to all other nodes in the network.In other words,
a node c is congenial if it has a degree of N−1 (i.e., it has edges connecting to every other node in the tree).Your task 
is to find the congenial node in the given tree.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line consists of an integer N, which denotes the number of nodes in a given network.The next N-1 line consists
of pairs of two numbers that denote the connection of two given nodes.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print a single line consisting of an integer that is a congenial node.


CONSTRAINTS
3 <= N <= 2*10^5
Number of edges == N - 1
1 <= UI, VI <= N
UI != VI.

1 4
Testcase Output
1
Explanation
The given tree is:
     1
   / | \  \
  2 3 4 5
  
Node 1 is directly connected to all other nodes {2, 3, 4, 5}.
Since node 1 has a degree of 4 (N-1), it is the congenial node.

2 3
4 2
Testcase Output
2
Explanation
Given tree:
    2
   / | \
  1 3 4

Node 2 is directly connected to {1, 3, 4}.
Since node 2 has a degree of 3 (N-1), it is the congenial node.
