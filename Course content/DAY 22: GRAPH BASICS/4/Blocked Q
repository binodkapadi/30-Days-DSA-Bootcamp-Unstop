PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. Each edge connects two vertices and has a length of 1.For 
each edge i, determine the shortest distance from vertex 1 to vertex N when all edges except edge i are passable.If 
removing edge i makes vertex N unreachable from vertex 1, print -1.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains two integers representing the number of vertices n and the number of edges m.The next m lines
contain two integers each, Ai and Bi, denoting an edge between vertex A and vertex B.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print m lines. The i-th line should contain the shortest distance from vertex 1 to vertex N when all edges except i are
passable, or -1 if vertex N is unreachable from vertex 1.


CONSTRAINTS
2 <= N <= 4*10^2
1 <= m < n(n-1)
1 <= Ai, Bi <= n
Ai != Bi
(Ai, Bi) != (Aj, Bj) for i != j

Testcase Output
1
2
1
Explanation
Excluding the first edge, the shortest path is 1 through edge 1-3.
Excluding the second edge, the shortest path is 2 via edge 1-2 and 2-3.
Excluding the third edge, the shortest path is 1 through edge 1-2.

Testcase Output
-1
2
3
2
Explanation
If the first edge is excluded, there is no way to reach vertex 4 from vertex 1, so the output is -1.
Excluding the second edge, the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 4 is of length 2 via edge 1-2 and 2-4.
Excluding the third edge, the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 4 is of length 3 via edge 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4.
Excluding the fourth edge, the shortest path is again of length 2.
