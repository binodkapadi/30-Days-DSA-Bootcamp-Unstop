---------------Find the Center------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Once upon a time in a distant land, Saurav and Vikas set out to explore a star-shaped graph. This unique graph had 'n' 
nodes, with one special node known as the center, connected to all other nodes through 'n - 1' edges.They were given a 
scroll called 'edges' revealing connections between nodes as 'edges[i] = [ui, vi]'.Vikas, Aimed to identify the center 
node hidden within this magical graph. Their quest was to unveil this mystery and find the label of the elusive center 
node, where all paths converged.


INPUT FORMAT
First line of input contains n, the number of edges that will be available for input in the next lineSecond line of input
contains n pairs of intergers which are all space separated representing the starting and ending of edge.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Output the node that is the centre of the given star graph.


CONSTRAINTS
3 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= ui, vi <= n

4
1 3
2 3
4 3
5 3
Testcase Output
3
Explanation
In this scenario, node 3 is directly connected to all other nodes (1, 2, 4, and 5), making it the center of the star graph.

Testcase Input
5
1 2
2 3
3 1
4 1
5 1
Testcase Output
1
Explanation
Node 1 is connected to every other node, forming a star graph. Even though other nodes have
multiple connections, node 1 remains the center of the star graph in this configuration.
