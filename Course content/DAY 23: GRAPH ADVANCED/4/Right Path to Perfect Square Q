--------------Right Path to Perfect Square----------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a Binary Tree with the root node provided. Starting from the root, imagine traveling to the right until you 
reach a leaf node. During this traversal, collect the values of all the nodes encountered in your path.At the end of the 
traversal:
Calculate the sum of the collected node values.
Determine whether the sum is a perfect square. A number is considered a perfect square if it can be expressed as the
square of an integer (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16, etc.).
Note: Tree node values are given in a level-order traversel, where N in the sequence represents the NULL node.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains an integer M, representing the Nodes of the Tree.The second line contains M space-separated values,
representing the Tree Nodes in level order.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print "YES" if the sum of the collected values is a perfect square; otherwise, print "NO".


CONSTRAINTS
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^4


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
7
5 3 8 N N 6 10
Testcase Output
NO
Explanation
Level order traveral of the tree:
                             5
                           /     \ 
                        3         8
                                  /   \
                                6    10

Now we need to traverse toward right.
5 -> 8 -> 10
Sum = 23 (not a perfect square).

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 N N N N 10 14
Testcase Output
YES
Explanation
Level order traveral of the tree:
                             1 
                           /     \ 
                        2         3 
                     /     \      /    \
                  4        5   6     7 
                /   \                  /   \
              8     9              10   14

Now we need to traverse toward right.
1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 14
Sum = 25 (perfect square).
