QUESTION ==>>

PROBLEM STATEMENT
In a matrix, there is a snake and a man. The task is to find the number of paths the snake can take to reach the man’s 
location. The snake cannot travel through walls. If the snake can’t reach the man’s location, return 0. If the snake can 
reach the man’s location, return the number of ways the snake can travel. If either the man or the snake is not present, 
return 0.
Matrix Symbols:
‘s’ represents the snake’s position.
‘w’ represents a wall.
‘m’ represents the man’s position.
‘p’ represents a path the snake can move on.
The snake can move in four directions: up, down, right, and left.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains an integer N, the number of rows in the matrix.The second line contains an integer M, the
number of columns in the matrix.The next N lines contain M space-seperated characters each, representing the matrix.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print the number of ways the snake can reach the man’s location. If it can’t, print 0.


CONSTRAINTS
1 < N <= 7
1 < M <= 7

Snake can move in four directions, and if there is a wall, return and go other way until we reach the men's location.
This process happens again and again until we get all path
