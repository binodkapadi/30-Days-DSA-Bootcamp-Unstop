---------------Rearrange Linked List-------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
You have a list of numbers arranged in a specific order, and your task is to rearrange the numbers in a particular way.
Every third number should be grouped together while maintaining their original order within those groups.You need to 
make these changes directly in the original list without creating a new one. Finally, print the modified list.
For example, given the input linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 ,
the rearranged linked list should be: 1 -> 4 -> 7 -> 2 -> 5 -> 8 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains an integer, N, representing the number of elements in the linked list.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, representing the elements of the linked list.


OUTPUT FORMAT
The linked list may not always contain a number of elements that is a multiple of three. In such cases, any remaining
elements that cannot form a complete group of three should be placed at the end of the linked list in their original order.
After making these changes, display the modified linked list.


CONSTRAINTS
1 ≤ Size of the linked list (n) ≤ 10^4
0 ≤ value of linked list ≤ 10^3


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
Testcase Output
1 4 2 5 3
Explanation
The original linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5. After rearranging, every third element forms a group. The groups 
are (1, 4), (2, 5), and (3). Within each group, the elements maintain their original order. Therefore, the modified 
linked list is 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
6
10 20 30 40 50 60
Testcase Output
10 40 20 50 30 60
Explanation
The original linked list is 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> 60. After rearranging, every third element forms a group.
The groups are (10, 40), (20, 50), and (30, 60). Within each group, the elements maintain their original order. Therefore, 
the modified, linked list is 10 -> 40 -> 20 -> 50 -> 30 -> 60.
