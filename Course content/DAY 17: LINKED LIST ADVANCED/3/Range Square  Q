QUESTION ===>>

------------Range Square---------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a linked list and two integers, N1 and N2. Your task is to determine if any node in the linked list contains 
a value that is a perfect square of an integer within the range from N1 to N2 (both inclusive).If there is at least one 
node in the linked list that holds such a value, the program should output 1. Otherwise, it should output 0.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains two integers separated by a space, N1 and N2, representing the range of values.The second line 
contains a single integer, N, indicating the number of elements in the linked list.The third lines contain N space 
separated integer, representing values to be inserted into the linked list.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print 1 if any node in the linked list contains a value that is a perfect square of an integer between N1 and N2 
(inclusive).Print 0 if no such value is found in the linked list.


CONSTRAINTS
1 <= N <= 10^4
1<=N1<=10^2
1<=N2<=10^2
0 <= element <= 10^5


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
2 4
5
1 2 3 4 5
Testcase Output
1
Explanation
For the given test case, the range is from 2 to 4. The linked list has five elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. When checking
for perfect square values within the range, we find that 4 is a perfect square. Therefore, the output is 1, indicating
that a perfect square exists in the linked list.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
4 6
3
100 200 300
Testcase Output
0
Explanation
In the given test case, the range is from 4 to 6 (inclusive). The linked list contains three elements: 100, 200, and 300. 
However, none of these values are perfect squares within the range, so the output is 0.
