--------------Swapping Linked List Node--------------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Ram gave Shyaam a challenge, he gave shyaam the head of a linked list, and an integer K.He asked Shyaam to swap the values
of the Kth node from the beginning and the Kth node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).Note: The number of nodes in the 
list is N.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains an integer N, representing the number of nodes in the linked list.The second line contains N
space-separated integers, each representing the value of a node in the linked list.The third line contains an integer K, 
indicating the positions of the nodes to be swapped.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Output the linked list after swapping the values of the two specified nodes. by space-separated integers


CONSTRAINTS
1 <= K <= N <= 10^5
0 <= Node.val <= 10^2


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
3
Testcase Output
1 2 3 4 5
Explanation
The 3rd node from the start is 3 and the 3rd node from the end is also 3.
Since the nodes are the same, no swapping is needed


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
Testcase Output
1 4 3 2 5
Explanation
The 2nd node from the start is 2 and the 2nd node from the end is 4.
After swapping their values, the list becomes: 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5.
2 is the second node and 4 is the 2nd last node values of which are swapped.
