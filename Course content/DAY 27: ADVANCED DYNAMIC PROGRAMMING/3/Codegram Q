------------------Codegram-----------------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Alice created a social media app called "Codegram." In this app, there's a feature called "Probab-list." If you follow a
person, say P, then not only does P's account get added to your Probab-list, but all the accounts in P's Probab-list also 
get added to yours. Now, imagine a social network represented by a directed graph where each person is a node, and there's
an edge from person u to person v if u follows v. Your task is to figure out the smallest number of people needed to create
a social network where there are exactly N pairs of people who are mutual Probab-list friends. Among all such social 
networks with the minimum number of people, find the maximum number of pairs of people such that one person is in the
other’s Probab-list but not vice versa.


INPUT FORMAT
The first a line of input contains a single integer N, representing the number of pairs of people who need to be mutual
Probab-list friends.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Display two integers separated by a space. The first integer is the minimum number of people required. The second integer
is the maximum number of one-way follower pairs in such a network.


CONSTRAINTS
0 <= N <= 10^6


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
3
Testcase Output
3 0
Explanation
Here, there are exactly 3 pairs who are in each other’s Probab-list. So, the minimum number of nodes required is 3, and 
there is no pair where Person A is in the probab-list of B but not the opposite.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
0
Testcase Output
0 0
Explanation
Here, we need exactly 0 pairs who are in each other’s Probab-list. So, the minimum nodes required are 0. So, there will
be no social networks on Codegram.
