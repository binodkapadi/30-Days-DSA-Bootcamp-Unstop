-----------------Vertices with Maximum Matching Invariance---------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a tree with N vertices labeled from 1 to N. The tree consists of N-1 edges, where the i-th edge connects the 
vertices ui and vi. A matching in a graph is a set of edges such that no two edges share a common vertex. The maximum 
matching of a graph is the largest possible matching. Your task is to find the number of vertices i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) that can be 
removed along with all their incident edges, such that the size of the maximum matching remains the same as the original
tree.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line of input contains an integer N,representing the number of vertices in the tree. The next N-1 lines of input 
contains two space-seprtaed integers denoting the edge between u_i and v_i.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print a single integer, representing the count of vertices that can be removed while keeping the size of the maximum 
matching unchanged.


CONSTRAINTS
2 <= N <= 2*10^5
1<= u_i,v_i <=N


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
2
1 2
Testcase Output
0
Explanation
The original tree has only one edge (1-2). The maximum matching is 1.
Removing either node 1 or node 2 leaves a single node, which has no edges, reducing the matching size to 0.
No valid removals exist → Answer = 0.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
3
1 2
2 3
Testcase Output
2
Explanation
The original tree has a maximum matching of 1:
1 - 2 - 3
Maximum matching: (1-2) or (2-3) (size = 1)
Remove node 1:
The remaining tree is 2 - 3
Maximum matching is 1, which remains the same. 

Remove node 2:
The remaining tree is two isolated nodes (1, 3)
No possible matching (size = 0) 

Remove node 3:
The remaining tree is 1 - 2
Maximum matching is 1, which remains the same. 
Valid removals: Nodes {1, 3} → Count = 2.
