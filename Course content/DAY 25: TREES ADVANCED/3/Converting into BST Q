----------------Converting into BST------------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a binary tree represented by an array Arr. In one operation, you can increment the value of any node in the
binary tree by +1. Your goal is to convert the binary tree into a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the minimum number of 
operations.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line of input contains an integer N, representing the size of the array Arr. The second line of input contains N 
space seperated integers ,representing the values of the nodes.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Dsiplay the minimum number of operations required to convert the binary tree into a binary search tree.


CONSTRAINTS
1 ≤  N ≤10^5
1 ≤  Arr[i] ≤10^5

Explanation
We have to change the following, 
3 to 6 (3 operations)
6 to 7 (1 operations)
2 to 8 (6 operations)
4 to 9 (5 operations)
The total number of operations is 15.
