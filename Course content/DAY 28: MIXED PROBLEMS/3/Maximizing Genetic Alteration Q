-----------------Maximizing Genetic Alteration--------------------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT
In a futuristic world, humans have discovered a method to alter their genetic structure using nanotechnology. This 
technology allows individuals to enhance their physical abilities, but with each enhancement, there is a trade-off. The
"Genetic Alteration" is represented by a number, which corresponds to the total number of genetic modifications an 
individual has undergone. The process of enhancing one's genetic structure is governed by a series of operations that can
be performed on the initial genetic value. Specifically, the value of the "Genetic Alteration" can be reduced by dividing 
it by 2, 3, or 4 in each operation. This process can be repeated as many times as needed. Once the alterations reach a 
certain level, the individual can choose to finalize their enhancements and "unlock" a new level of physical ability, 
represented by a final value of the genetic alteration. The goal is to maximize the physical ability enhancement level by
performing the available operations and then finalizing the genetic alteration.
Task:
Given an initial genetic alteration value N, find out the maximum possible physical ability enhancement level that can be
achieved through this process.


INPUT FORMAT
The input consists of a single integer N, representing the initial genetic alteration value.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Print the maximum possible enhancement level achievable by performing the available operations.


CONSTRAINTS
1 <= N <= 10^6


SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
6
Testcase Output
6
Explanation
We compare two possibilities:
Keeping 6 as is.
Splitting 6 into 6/2, 6/3, and 6/4 (i.e., 3, 2, and 1).
We find the enhancements for those parts (3, 2, 1) individually:
Enhancement(3) = 3
Enhancement(2) = 2
Enhancement(1) = 1
Their total is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
Compare 6 with 6. They are equal, so the maximum is still 6.


SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
12
Testcase Output
13
Explanation
We compare two possibilities:
Keeping 12 as is.
Splitting 12 into 12/2, 12/3, and 12/4 (i.e., 6, 4, and 3).
We find the enhancements for those parts (6, 4, 3) individually:
Enhancement(6) = 6
Enhancement(4) = 4
Enhancement(3) = 3
Their total is 6 + 4 + 3 = 13.
Compare 13 with 12. The higher value is 13.
